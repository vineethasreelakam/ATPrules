                        Tour or special event during that tournament week. Once a player enters and is
                        accepted into the main draw of singles, doubles, or the qualifying competition, he is
                        committed to that tournament for the week, unless released by the Senior Vice President - Rules & Competition or Supervisor. A player who loses in the singles qualifying
                        competition may enter the doubles event of any tournament.

                        qualifying for the next weekâ€™s ATP Tour and ATP Challenger Tour tournaments provided that no special scheduling by either tournament shall be required. In the event of
                        a conflict, he shall be withdrawn from such qualifying so as to compete in the singles
