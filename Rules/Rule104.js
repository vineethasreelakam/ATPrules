                        Seeds are players who are given preferential positions in the draw based on the
                        Pepperstone ATP Rankings. The selection and arrangement of seeds shall be based
                        upon the most recent Pepperstone ATP Rankings list (the protected ranking is not
                        considered). Each tournament shall have a seeded draw and there shall be only one
                        seeding list. Seeding shall not be official until the final draw is made. For doubles,
                        seeded teams will be determined by using the combined Pepperstone ATP Doubles
                        Rankings of the two players (entry protection not included).
