                        Correct When Left Out of Draw
                        Case: After the qualifying draw has been made, it is discovered that
                        player A, who was properly entered, has been left out of the draw.
                        What is the procedure to correct this mistake?

                        {'\n\n'}
                        1. If player A is unseeded, replace the last direct acceptance in the
                        qualifying draw with player A in the draw. Follow this procedure if
                        play has begun unless the last direct acceptance has begun his first
                        match. If the last direct acceptance has started his first match then
                        no correction is to be made and player A is left out of the draw.
                        {'\n\n'}
                        2. If player A is seeded, then if he is one of the top four (4) seeds he
                        replaces seed four (4) and then seed four (4) replaces seed eight
                        (8). Seed eight (8) then replaces the last direct acceptance. If player
                        A is to be seeded 5-8, then he shall replace seed eight (8) and
                        then seed eight (8) replaces the last direct acceptance. The same
                        principle is followed for larger qualifying draws where you have a
                        greater number of seeds. If play has begun, then the Supervisor
                        shall evaluate the impact upon the draw and correct when possible.
                        If the last direct acceptance has begun play, then no corrections are
                        possible.
