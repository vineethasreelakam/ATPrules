            The TACP currently provides that no Covered Person shall, directly or indirectly, facilitate any other person to wager on the outcome or any other aspect of any professional tennis event or any other tennis competition. The ITIA has determined that the
            provision of the following benefits by a tournament to a Tennis Betting Operator would
            be deemed to be “facilitation” and are therefore prohibited and subject to penalty
            under the TACP:
            {'\n\n'}1) Direct linking from a tournament digital or social media platform to a Tennis Betting Operator website where tennis wagers can be placed (i.e., one (1) click 1)
            (for the avoidance of doubt indirect linking (i.e., two (2) clicks) from a tournament
            digital or social media platform to a Tennis Betting Operator website where tennis
            wagers can be placed is allowed).
            {'\n\n'}2) Displaying live odds for matches on a tournament digital or social media platform
            (including in a match stream shown on such platform);
            {'\n\n'}3) Offering and accepting tennis wagers on behalf of a Tennis Betting Operator on
            any tournament digital or social media platform or otherwise;
            {'\n\n'}4) Allowing a Tennis Betting Operator, directly or through a third party, to offer and
            accept in-person tennis wagers at a tournament site or at any official tournament-related event (e.g., at a booth or party);
            {'\n\n'}5) In-stadia or on-site tournament or Tennis Betting Operator advertising that encourages spectators to place an in-venue tennis wager (e.g., go to website and
            place a bet now);
            {'\n\n'}6) Any of the following activities by tournament owner, operator, director, or employee in their individual capacity:
            {'\n\t'}● Serving as a spokesperson / ambassador for a Tennis Betting Operator;

            benefit from a Tennis Betting Operator.
            {'\n\n'}
            In addition, the provision of the following benefits to a Tennis Betting Operator would
            be deemed to be “facilitation” by an active player (i.e., any player who has not officially retired), player support team member, and/or official and therefore tournaments are
            prohibited from providing such sponsorship benefits in order to safeguard players,
            player support team members and officials from inadvertent violations of the TACP:
            {'\n\n'}1) No player/player support team/official activation of any nature, this includes:
            {'\n\t'}● appearances at a Tennis Betting Operator information booth or box;

            {'\n\n'}3) No provision of gear or merchandise with Tennis Betting Operator logos or branding to players/player support team members/officials for use on or off the court
            (e.g., towels, water bottles, tape);
            {'\n\n'}4) No provision of hospitality or gifts, free or subsided travel, or any other personal
            benefit to a player/player support team member/official from a Tennis Betting Operator.
